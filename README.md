# Show My Records

This is a small web application I created to display my record collection. It obtains my collection data from Discogs, a popular website for buying, selling, and learning about vinyl records and other types of media.

## Demo

## Current Features

When managing your collection on Discogs, users are able to sort their collection into any number of folders.
Once 'Load Folders' is clicked, server grabs each folder created by the user (as well as the 'All' and 'Uncategorized' folders created by Discogs).
Then, in a dropdown, the you can pick any folder of your choice to be displayed as a grid below.

## Future Features (In Progress)

- Add a 'play' button to each item, which when pressed will call Spotify's API and play a 30 second snippet.
- Allow sorting for the items (by year, artist, title, etc)
- Allow other Discogs users to sign in and try for themselves.
- Deploy the project on Heroku.
